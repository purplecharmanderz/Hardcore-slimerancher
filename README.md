# Hardcore-slimerancher
first functional mod i've made for anything really.

to install this mod just replace the Assembly-Csharp.dll file in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Slime Rancher\SlimeRancher_Data\Managed with the file you'll get with this.

this mod is designed to test your skills and push your limits, life wont get easy with this mod but a sense of achievement can be obtained with this mod.

just to get you started here are a couple challenges for you.
 - collect and free range one of every ranchable slime on your ranch at once.
 - stay in the indigo quarry for 72 hours straight (in game).
 - free range to the 28th 7zee rank
 - have a hundred elder chickens living in a corral.
 
 more will be added as the mod expands, hope you enjoy the mod.
 
 features
 - slimes are more difficult to deal with
    -rocks roll almost constantly
    - crystals produce longer lasting crystals more often
    - booms explode more often
    - dervish slimes produce more tornados at a lower agitation level.
  - selling plorts go for half the listed price on the plort market.
  - plorts explode after a minute (real life)
  - chickens got tweaked.
    - have fun and raise a few.
